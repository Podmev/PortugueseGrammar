Grammatic engine for Brazilian Portuguese

Main part is about verbs

Things to do:
 - Find data for all verbs in all conjugation forms, like big dictionary in file
 - Create conjugator for verbs with params: verb infinitive, pronoun, tense
 - create tests checking that conjugator works correct
 - most of forms should be evaluated analytically, exceptions should be saved in separate dicts

 Future development of engine
 - make lib
 - publish lib
 - make rest-api
 - deploy conjugation service with rest-api

 Architecture:
  - enums for pronouns
  - enums for tenses and grammatic forms
  - structure for all forms for one verb
