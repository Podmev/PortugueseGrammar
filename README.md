# PortugueseGrammar
Grammatical engine for Brazilian Portuguese

Main part is about verbs

Things to do:
 - Find data for all verbs in all conjugation forms, like big dictionary in file
 - Find list of verbs
 - validate input data (verbs and forms)
 - find list of verbs ordered by using frequency
 - Create conjugator for verbs with params: verb infinitive, pronoun, tense
 - create tests checking that conjugator works correct
 - most of the forms should be evaluated analytically, exceptions should be saved in separate dicts

 Future development of engine
 - make lib
 - publish lib
 - make rest-api
 - deploy conjugation service with rest-api
 - deploy site with verb form constructor, quiz
 - support other languages' grammar (with similar grammar) - Italian, French, Spanish

 Architecture:
  - enums for pronouns
  - enums for tenses and grammatical forms
  - structure for all forms for one verb


Quiz App (next project) - Conjugation test
 - For verb make all conjugation for all tenses and pronouns
 - It can be like small spreadsheet or one by one random
 - By verb in form say which is pronoun, tense and voice
 - By verb say which is infinitive
 - By verb in some form write verb in other form

the underlying problem is that the file is not executable, which you'll need to change in your repository. If you're on Windows, that may be why the file did not get added as executable in your repository. On Windows, you can run:

    git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew
Then commit and push this change.
