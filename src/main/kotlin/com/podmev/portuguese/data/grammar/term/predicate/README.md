https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)

The term predicate is used in one of two ways in linguistics and its subfields.
The first defines a predicate as everything in a standard declarative sentence except the subject,
and the other views it as just the main content verb or associated predicative expression of a clause.
Thus, by the first definition the predicate of the sentence Frank likes cake is likes cake.
By the second definition, the predicate of the same sentence is just the content verb likes,
whereby Frank and cake are the arguments of this predicate.
Differences between these two definitions can lead to confusion

In the project it is used 'predicate' in second definition: only verb part
